workaround_r8192se.sh

A simple bash script for working around buggy drivers for the Realtek 8192SE 
wifi card. The 64 bit version of the official driver (kernel module 
r8192se_pci) tends to drop connections randomly. This script regularly pings 
your router (or any other host you specify) to check whether the connection is 
still up; if not, it reloads the kernel module and waits for NetworkManager (or 
whatever you use) to reassociate with your wireless access point. This usually 
fixes things up until the next random disconnect. Joy!

If the necessity of running this script just to use wifi on your 64 bit machine 
bothers you, complain to Realtek, the authors of the buggy driver.
